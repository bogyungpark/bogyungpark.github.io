Hello! I'm BoGyung Park. 

I majored in Information Statistics at Dongduk Women's University for my undergraduate studies. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree in AI at Chung-Ang University. My research interests revolve around machine learning/deep learning, data analysis, audio recognition, speech processing, emotion, and classification.

This blog is a platform to share my research and learning experiences, engage in paper reviews on various topics, and document my learnings. I primarily focus on conducting paper reviews, striving to explain the latest research trends and technical concepts easily.

If you would like to learn more about me or are interested in my blog, please feel free to contact me via the email below. I enjoy receiving questions and feedback as it helps me provide better content.

Thank you for visiting my blog!
